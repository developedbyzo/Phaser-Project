 # Present Saver: Santa
Oh no, it's Christmas Eve and Santa lost some of the children's gifts! Santa needs your help in recovering them all!
Present Saver: Santa is a simple item collecting game. Players are asked by Santa for their help in collecting all of the presents that fell from his sleigh. This version of the game is only a demo.

### Technology Used
This game was designed using [Phaser](phaser.io). Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It offers WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps via 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.

### Steps Taken
This was fun project to do. It's amazing the things you are capable of creating with the help of Phaser. It should be noted that this was my first game. To create this game, used the guidance of Phaser's learn section and varies HTML5 game forums for answers to my many questions.
